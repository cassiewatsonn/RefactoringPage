When I view the source code, I find semantic HTML elements.
When I view the structure of the HTML elements, I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
When I view the icon and image elements, I find accessible alt attributes.
When I view the heading attributes, they fall in sequential order.
When I view the title element, I find a concise, descriptive title.
